# ProfHire
## Landing page for profhire.com with animations  

You can see it in action here: https://www.profhire.com/applicant

My assignment was to create a landing page for people coming in from ads. It was to be the main gateway to the website for applicants. It needed to quickly and simply explain the process of ProfHire so people would be motivated to fill out their profile.

I was to design , layout in html/css, and itegrate the files into the existing php using bootsrap aswell.

It was a great learning opportunity. I got to show off my svg/animation skills.

Tooltips and modals were added last minute.

Thanks for reading
